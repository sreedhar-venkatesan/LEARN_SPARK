# Lear pyspark with me through the codes.

* Thanks to freecodecamp.org. This learning has been made possible by their youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C8kWso4ne4
* The datasets and code are created by myself following the syllabus and structure of freecodecamp
* I started with vscode IDE and later switched to jupyter notebook as it has advantage of running each part of the code seperatly without necessarily running the whole code from begining each time.
* The code could be used for learning purpose for sure

## Topics covered
* Basic dataframe of pyspark
* running a linear regression ML 
* running a multi-variate linear regression ML
